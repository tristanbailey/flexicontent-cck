Advanced Content Manager and CCK for Joomla

FLEXIcontent is an advanced content management system developed to greatly enhance the native article manager of Joomla! (com_content)

- Content Types (=custom forms)
- Many highly parametrized powerful fields with select content plugin triggering
- Drag-drop templating
- Multi-Category assignments (secondary & featured)
- High performance FACETED filtering !!!
- Author management with limitations for subscriptions sites
- etc

10x-20x more features in free version, compared to other Free CCK/Directory components

Thus, FLEXIcontent was designed to manage content in a broad sense:
- articles,
- image or video galleries,
- job offers,
- product catalogues,
- business directories,
- hotel directories
- etc
within a single user interface.

-- This means for the end user, unparalleled simplicity of use, everything happens in one place.  
-- Mastering 10 components to be able to administrate an entire website isnâ€™t required anymore.  
-- For the web designer / end user / developer, it means a lot less headaches of interoperability/maintenance  

Some of FLEXIcontent Unique features:  
(none in other component's Free versions, many unique compared to commercial versions)

-- Multiple Document versioning (combined with workflow and powerful notifications messages, see below)  
-- Multi-state Workflow to assist both editors & publishers to add/update content to your site  
-- Highly configurable powerful notification system: (Global) Component + Per Content Type + Per category  
-- High parametrized Fields(=joomla plugin each) (carefully structured to assist configuration and be performance wise)  
-- Powerful relation/reverse Relation fields to create custom Content Item sub-listing inside a Content Item
